    Come winter, the gates to Central Indias’s Largest Cultural Festival are opened, ushering in an unprecedented medley
    of excitement and zeal. The Cultural Extravaganza, studded with electrifying and exhilarating events and
    competitions, witnesses a whooping footfall of over 25,000 and a participation of around 5000 students in our
    campus. Conceptualized way back in 1988, Aarohi has come a long way in all realms both qualitatively and
    quantitatively and has firmly ensonced itself as the centrepiece of the cultural spectrum of the region. Aarohi is a
    Non-profit Organisation completely organised and co-ordinated by willingness and true spirits of a group of VNITian’s when
    their individual strengths and skills are combined with teamwork, in the pursuit of a common cause, in order to
    produce meaningful results for the organisation. Aarohi truly has become one of the most awaited festivals in India.
    This year, we will be celebrating the 28th edition of Aarohi at VNIT, Nagpur
